# Problem Description

Given an integer `n`. The task is to determine whether `n` is a power of **four**. 
An integer `n` is considered a power of **four** if there exists another integer `x` such that `n` is equal to `4` raised to the power of `x` (i.e., $n = 4^x$).
Return `true` if `n` is a power of **four**; otherwise, return `false`.

- Constraints:
    - `-2e31 <= n <= 2e31 - 1`

# Intuition

Hi there, 

Let\'s dive deep \uD83E\uDD3F into today\'s interesting problem.
The problem says that we want to find if given number `n` is **power** of four $n = 4^x$ or not.

Seems easy ?\uD83E\uDD14
Actually the first valid solution is **Brute Force**.
We can check all the **possible** power of fours and if our number is one of them then we return **true**.
Concise and simple. \uD83D\uDC4C
But what is our **range**, how many number we will **check** ? \uD83E\uDD14
our constraints are `2e31 <= n <= 2e31 - 1` so max number to check it power is `log(2e31) base 4` which is `15.5`.
But since this is the **maximum** value that **int** data type can hold so we will search maximum from `(0 -> 15)` because `4^16` will give us **integer** **overflow**.

Now, this is the **Brute Force** solution with $O(log(N)^2)$ complexity, can we do **better**?\uD83E\uDD14
Actually, we can !\uD83E\uDD2F
We will have some help from **math** especially **Logarithms**.\u2797\u2795
if we know that $n = 4^x$ then for sure `log(n) base 4` is an **integer** and if there is a **fraction** then `n` is not to the power of four.
```
EX1: n = 16
n = 4 ^ 2 => power of four
x = 2
```
```
EX2: n = 256
n = 4 ^ 4 => power of four
x = 4
```
```
EX3: n = 147
n = 4 ^ 3.6 => not power of four
x = 3.6
```

Great ! but how will we get that `log base 4` since programming languages don\'t implement it !.
Here comes the Logarithms properties. We have a rule called **Change of Base Rule**.

![image.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/users/images/0ad38031-72b7-487d-b223-9ea43b3851d9_1698028066.2028875.png)

Most of programming languages implements `log base 10` or `log base 2` or even `log base natural number e`.

We will **pick** one of these **implemented** logs and compute `log base 4` using them. and check if result if **integer** if not then it is not power of **four**.

Is there another valid solution ?\uD83E\uDD14
Say that I don\'t want to use this logarithmic **rule** and I am not good with it can I do something else? \uD83E\uDD28

Actually we can ! \uD83E\uDD2F

Let\'s see this observation.
n = $4 ^ x$
n = $(2 * 2) ^ x$
n = $2 ^ x$ * $2 ^ x$
sqrt(n) = $2 ^ x$
log2(sqrt(n)) = x

What is this ! \uD83E\uDD2F
This is the beauty of math. \uD83E\uDD29
We can get `x` without using change of base rule. since n = $4 ^ x$ so it is naturally **product** of two similar numbers then we can calculate its **square root**. then get its `log base 2` easily.
most programming languages implements `log base 2`. Sadly, except **Java** so we will go back to change of base rule.
But this also a valid solution if you are not using Java and don\'t want to calculate many logarithms.\uD83D\uDCAA


And this is the solution for our today\'S problem I hope that you understood it\uD83D\uDE80\uD83D\uDE80

# Approach

## Brute Force

1. Start an iteration from `i` equal to 0 to 15, representing powers of `4` from `4^0` to `4^15` since the maximum value that **int** can hold is `4^(15.5)`.
2. Calculate the `powerOfFour` by raising `4` to the power of `i`.
3. if `powerOfFour` is equal to the input integer `n`. If they are equal, return `true` because `n` is a power of four.
4. If `powerOfFour` becomes greater than `n`, there\'s no need to continue the loop, so return `false`.
5. If none of the powers of `4` match `n` during the loop, return `false` to indicate that `n` is not a power of four.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity:** $O(log(N)^2)$
Since we are iterating from `0` to `15` which `15` is `log(INT_MAX)` to the **base** of `4` and in each iteration we calculate the **power** of $4^i$ which is **logarithmic** operations so total complexity is `O(log(N)^2)`.
- **Space complexity:** $O(1)$
Since we are only storing constant variables.


---




## First Math Solution

1. Check if the input integer `n` is equal to `1`. If it is, return **true** since `1` is a power of four.
2. If `n` is **non-positive** (less than or equal to 0), return **false** since powers of four are **positive** integers.
3. Calculate the logarithm of \'n\' with a base of 4 and store the result in the variable \'logarithmBase4.\'
4. Check if \'logarithmBase4\' is an integer by comparing it to its integer cast. If they are equal, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity:** $O(1)$
Since we are only doing math operations without any loops or recursion.
- **Space complexity:** $O(1)$
Since we are only storing constant variables.

## Second Math Solution

1. Check if the input integer `n` is equal to `1`. If it is, return **true** since `1` is a power of four.
2. If `n` is **non-positive** (less than or equal to 0), return **false** since powers of four are **positive** integers.
3. Calculate the square root of `n` and store it in the variable `sqrtN`.
4. Compute the logarithm base `2` of `sqrtN` and store it in `log2SqrtN`.
5. Check if `log2SqrtN` is an integer (i.e., it has no fractional part). If it is an integer, return **true**; otherwise, return **false**.

## Complexity
- **Time complexity:** $O(1)$
Since we are only doing math operations without any loops or recursion.
