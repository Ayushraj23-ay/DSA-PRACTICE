**This will work on the statement that :-
When you have to do something, do your best. But when things happen to you, prepare for worst ( HAPPY LIFE MANTRA :))**
*Case 1:
Alex takes (i)th pile than array became (i+1, j)
now if Lee will take the (i+1)th pile then array became (i+2, j)
and if Lee will take the (j)th pile then array became (i+1, j-1)
=> Lee is supposed to take the maxi among 2 choices then Alex will reamin with min of these 2 choices
                    
Case 2:
Alex takes (j)th pile than array became (i, j-1)
now if Lee will take the (i)th pile then array became (i+1, j-1)
and if Lee will take the (j-1)th pile then array became (i, j-2)
=> Lee is supposed to take the maxi among 2 choices then Alex will reamin with min of these 2 choices*
